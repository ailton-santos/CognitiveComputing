# Cognitive Computing

## Ailton Santos


Cognitive computing application to perform a sentiment analysis of a text typed by the patient using the NLTK and TextBlob libraries adding a psychoanalytic analysis according to the sentiment identified in the text. To do this, we define some criteria that can indicate psychological tendencies of the patient. For example, if the feeling identified is positive, we can consider that the patient has a tendency to overestimate the situation. On the other hand, if the feeling identified is negative, we can consider that the patient presents a tendency to underestimate the situation.
